# SOUP (Software of Unknown Pedigree)

This document provides a list of third-party dependencies and their associated risks. The aim is to ensure that we track and manage all unknown or partially verified software libraries. This approach helps maintain compliance, security, and licensing clarity.

## SOUP Dependencies

{{DEPENDENCY_TABLE}}

## Why We Need a SOUP System

A üç≤**SOUP** system catalogs all third-party libraries that may have uncertain origins or licensing details, especially in **safety-critical** or **compliance-oriented** environments. Tracking these dependencies helps:

- Identify licensing requirements and constraints.
- Monitor security vulnerabilities and maintenance activity.
- Provide transparency for lawyers and auditors.

Since we do a lot of work in a very compliance-oriented vertical (legal), this documentation is mandatory for all products we sell, e.g. Call Connector and similar.

## Implementation Details

This SOUP list is generated automatically through a [**central workflows repository**](https://github.com/ion8/workflows). Whenever dependencies change in this project, GitHub Actions invokes a workflow that runs the [`cook_soup.py`](https://github.com/ion8/workflows/blob/main/.github/scripts/cook_soup.py) script. It scans licenses and metadata, then updates this file with current information. This all happens automagically ‚ú®

For more details on the central workflow system, see the [workflows repo README](https://github.com/ion8/workflows#readme).
