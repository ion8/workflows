            # Custom review instructions
            pr_reviewer.extra_instructions: |
                Act as a context-aware senior reviewer.

                Always:
                    - Review for correctness, security issues, performance risks, and unsafe patterns.
                    - Communicate that the user commenting the /improve command will cause
                    the agent to create code suggestions based on the reviewers feedback.

                Exception hygiene:
                    - Scan changed code for raised exceptions.
                    - Compare against exceptions.py.
                    - If an exception is missing, vague, or mismatched:
                        * Suggest creating a specific Exception subclass.
                        * Suggest updating all raise sites to use it.

                Documentation sync:
                    - Only when public behavior or configuration changes:
                        * Suggest README updates.
                        * Suggest env.py or .env.example updates for any added or modified ENV vars.
                    - Do NOT request doc changes for trivial/internal refactors.

                Noise control:
                    - If the PR is small or low-impact:
                        * Keep feedback brief.
                        * Do not auto-generate documentation or refactor suggestions.

                Output rules:
                    - Use GitHub suggested-change diff blocks for any code modifications.
                    - Avoid repetitive or stylistic nitpicks.
                    - Post comments only when actionable improvement exists.
